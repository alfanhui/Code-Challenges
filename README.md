Welcome to the Code-Challenges wiki!

"But I don't know python!?": So long as you know a language like Java or C/CPP then you're pretty good to go. 
Just a few remarks about the python: 

### 1. Python is an interpreter language, this means python code is run by 'python3 source.py' without compiling. Also, be to date, stick with python3. There is python 2.7, majority of code will run either way, but best to keep up-to-date.
 
### 2. Python loves indentations! You will see there little uses of {} in the code to define methods/functions. Below is a java/python method comparison:
Java:

> `     public int method(int i, String s){`
>          `//some awesome sauce`
> `}`

Python:

> `     def method(i, s):`
>          `#some better sauce`

Notice! def means define.. always gunna need it for function with colon:. 

### 3. Python variables do not need to be declared by type. Look at example below:<br>
Java:
> `int i = 0;`<br>

Python:
> `i = 0`<br>

As 0 is clearly an integer, i will then be int. IF you want to make sure a variable has a pre-defined type then:    

> `(float)i = 0`

### 4. Python loops makes you really happy. Look at this!
Java:<br>
> `     for(int i = 0; i < j; i++){`
>          `//ewwwwwww`
> `}`

Python:
> `     for i in 10:`
>          `#zomggg so easy!`

Anything else you are better off making StackOverflow your friend.

OK, so you know a bit of python. What's the crack with this challenge? So, it's really just me being slightly selfish in pushing myself to understand these algorithms, get some practise done and you're joining me for the ride. Your welcome to send me email of your issues with the challenges and ill try and get round to helping out. Also, I can check over your work after you're finished. The asserts should prove to you that your code works, but there's no harm in seeing if there is a better way.

There's no time limits: If you feel that this challenge is too difficult, then wait for the next challenge to appear. I have no timeframes, so just check the labs for posters and go from there. Later I hope to cover some basic machine learning to get you to understand how computers can actually learn. I may <MAY> do a lecture to support a challenge, but I really want you guys to self-study. 

OH! and Fork the challenges each time, so you have your own copy to work upon. <br>
CIAO and good luck, <br>
